Come up with an example of data that would naturally be stored in a priority queue.

A to do list of things a corporate worker might have to do: tasks get added and need to be done but some are more important than others.

I think the implementation of PriorityQueue hashmap might not store duplicate values; unsure if I chose the best structure for this.

I used a hashmap for the priorityqueue implementation because I saw the tuple of (position, element) and thought that ordered pairs
called for hashmaps.
